# Control-Flow-Error-Handling

## Challenge 1: API Interaction and Data Processing

### Challange description:

We fetched weather data for a specified city using the openWeatherMap API. The weather data is displaying city's temperature and weather conditions.

### Problem Solving notes:

- Used node-fetch to retrieve weather data for a given city from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Checked for the errors and ensure that valid data is returned.
- Extracted the description and temperature from the json response and displayed it.

### Resources:

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### Self Reflection:

- Weather data was successfully fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API and I have applied error handling. Through this project I learned how to fetch and handle api data in Node.js and how to manage errors effectively.
